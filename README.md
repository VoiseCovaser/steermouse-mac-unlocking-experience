## 🌍 Example Profile Configuration

**Create a profile for Adobe Photoshop with specific mouse action mappings:**

    - Profile Name: Photoshop–Precision
    - Pointer Sensitivity: 25% slower
    - Button 4: Undo (Cmd + Z)
    - Button 5: Brush Tool (B)
    - Scroll Wheel: Zoom In/Out (when held with Cmd)

This configuration turns your mouse into a digital paintbrush and eraser, all on the fly.
